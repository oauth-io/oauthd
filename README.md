The first time you connect, the given login & pass will be registered as the admin user, so don't forget it !

Then you can include the generated js sdk from oauthd to use it on your sites. By example for a local test:
`<script src="http://localhost:6284/download/latest/oauth.js"></script>`

You may configure config.js in oauthd folder, to configure your ports, connection with redis, enable ssl etc.

Then the admin interface is available to your url / port set into config.js, at /admin.
